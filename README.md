- Fetch all/unread notifications
- Patch to mark notifications as read
- SignalR for real-time delivery
- Email notifications via SMTP
- Hangfire used for scheduling recurring/email jobs

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Health Check Endpoint

- Checks:
  - Application is alive
  - Database connectivity
  - SMTP server connectivity
- Available at `/health`

---

## üìã Task Management

Each task includes:

| Field              | Type                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| `type`            | once / repetitive        |

| `reminderFreq`    | (optional override)      |
| `description`     | string                   |

Endpoints:
- `POST /tasks` ‚Äì Create new task
- `GET /tasks` ‚Äì List tasks
- `PATCH /tasks/{id}` ‚Äì Update/complete a task

---

## üë• Team & RBAC

Supports multi-user teams and role-based access.

### Entities

- `Team`: created by a user
- `TeamMember`: user-role mapping within a team
- `Role`: defines access level (e.g., Manager, Member)
- `Permission`: what actions a role can perform
- `RolePermission`: link between roles and permissions

### Example Roles

| Role     | Permissions                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Admin    | All                                         |
| Manager  | Create team, invite users, assign tasks     |
| Member   | View & complete assigned tasks              |
| Viewer   | View tasks and team                         |

### Endpoints

- `POST /teams` ‚Äì Create team
- `POST /teams/{id}/members` ‚Äì Add member (Manager only)
- `GET /teams/{id}/members` ‚Äì List team members
- `PATCH /teams/{id}/members/{userId}/role` ‚Äì Change role

RBAC enforced via `[HasPermission("action")]` style checks or middleware.

- Hangfire dashboard enabled at `/hangfire`

---

## üü¢ SignalR (Realtime Layer)

- Sends welcome message after login
- Pushes notification instantly when assigned
- Connected on frontend with `HubConnection`
